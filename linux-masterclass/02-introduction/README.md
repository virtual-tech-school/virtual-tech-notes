## What is Bootloader?

It is a program that responsible for intializing the *Operating System.*

 ## What is OS (Operating System)?
 
 An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs. 
 
 ## Things is present is every OS?

 - Should be able to manipulatte data based on command.
 
## What is file system?

Method or Data Structure that the OS use to store and retrieve the data in the memory



## What is kernel?
The kernel is a core component of an operating system and serves as the main interface between the computer's physical hardware and the processes running on it. 
It is also known is Bridge between *==Software==* and *==Hardware.==*

## What are Most Popular OS ?
- Microsoft Windows
- Mac OS (Only on apple)
- Linux (UNIX based)
- Android 
- IOS (iPhone Operating system)

# Why use Linux
 - Open Source 
 - Support almost all *Programming Language*
 - Developer Friendly
 - Terminal is superior to CMD
 - Bash Scripting 
 - SSH

  ## History of Linux?
 
  In **1969** First unix OS created by Ken Thompson and Dennis Richie
  10 years Later Richard Stallman started working on GNU project (BSD , MINIX, etc)
  In **1991** Linux Torvalds started working *Linux Kernel.*  The kernel was use in every linux distro..

  ## Linux Torvalds is a father of *Linux*
