 ## **What is OS (Operating System)?**
 
 An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs. 
 some examples of popular operating systems:
 Linux
 Mac OS
 Windows
 Solaris


 
 ___
## **An operating system should have :**
 - Kernel
 - File system
 - User interface (GUI & CLI)
 - Should be able to manipulate data based on command.
 ___
 
## **What is file system?**

Method or Data Structure that the OS use to store and retrieve the data in the memory.

___

## **What is kernel?**
The kernel is a core component of an operating system and serves as the main interface between the computer's physical hardware and the processes running on it. 
It is also known as bridge between *Software* and *Hardware.*
___

## **What are Most Popular OS ?**
- Microsoft Windows.
- Mac OS (Only on apple).
- Linux (UNIX based).
- Android.
- iOS (iPhone Operating system).
___

## **Why use Linux?**
 - Open Source.
 - Support almost all *Programming Languages*.
 - Developer Friendly.
 - Terminal is superior to CMD.
 - Bash Scripting .
 - SSH (Secure Shell).
 - Easily Customizable.
 - Provides better Aesthetics.

  ## **History of Linux**
 
  In **1969** First unix OS created by <u>*Ken Thompson*</u> and <u>*Dennis M. Ritchie*</u>
  10 years later <u>*Richard Stallman*</u> started working on GNU project (BSD , MINIX, etc).

  In **1991** <u>*Linus Torvalds* </u>started working on the "Linux Kernel". This kernel was used in every linux distribution.

>Linus Torvalds is the father of *Linux*  


## **Linux Distributions** 
 - Ubuntu
 - Fedora
 - Arch
 - Kali Linux
 - Pop OS and many more

As a beginner you should start out with Ubuntu.

## **Why Ubuntu than any other distribution?**
- It is Beginner Friendly
- It has a decent UI (user interface)
- Ease to use for non-programmer also

>Fun fact : Linux is all about of Keyboard
___

## **What is Terminal?**

A terminal(black window) is a tool where we are going to write our commands.Start terminal using this command : `ctrl+alt+t` or you can press windows button and type terminal.

 >Just like how Python (a programming language) works.
 ___
 
 ## **What is BASH Programming?**
 
 Every command we are writing on the terminal is a BASH language.
 ___
 
 ## **Shell Format**
 `apoorvgoyal@apoorvtwts:~$`
  this is the format of shell, lets understand what all this means:
  
  - `apoorvgoyal` : username 
  - `@apoortwts` : hostname
  - `~` : represents the home directory of the user('~' symbol is called tilde)
  - `$` : after this you can start writing command
  ___
  
## **Printing "Hello World" in terminal**
 `apoorvgoyal@apoorvtwts:~$ echo "Hello World" `
 ___
  
## **pwd (Print Working Directory)**
 The pwd command writes the full pathname of the current working directory to the standard output.<br>
  `apoorvgoyal@apoorvtwts:~$ pwd`
  ___

 ## **File Structure in Linux**
 The linux file hierarchy structure or the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) defines the directory structure and directory contents in Unix like operating systems. It is maintained by the Linux Foundation.
